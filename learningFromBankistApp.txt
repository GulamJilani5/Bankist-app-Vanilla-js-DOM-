#lec191,192 Event Propagation: Bubbling and Capturing  , Event Propagation in Practices
     event bubbling, Capturing, e.target(target phase element), e.currentTarget(Where event handler has been attached, equal to the 'this'), 
      'this' refers to the element on which event has been added. this === e.currentTarget is true

#lec193 Event Delegation: Implementing Page Navigation

#lec195 Building a tabbed component
    -6m.20s Event delegation use case of the tabbed component 
    -8m.10s Amazing concept to learn about clicking of the the button even when it has some span element
      e.target.closest('.operations__tab')
    -12m.53s Clicking issue that occurred due to closest() method, we will resolve it with Gaurd Clause.
     if(!clicked) return 
    -17m.20s Best use case of the data atrribute

#196 Passing arguments to Event handler
     Getting the knowledge of the difference between 'mouseover' and 'mouseenter'
    -4m.20s Comparison with tabbed component why to use classList()
    -6m.20s selecting siblings and child element based on the parent element(***need to understand better)
    -12m.50s addEventHandler is expecting a callback function(evetn handler function) which will take

#200 Lazy Loading Images
     Using dataset attribute to initially show lesser size faded image.
     And then loading the actual image when we are near to the see the image on viewport.

     1m.0s how image has been managed in the html with the dataset attribute.
